# Trajectory Control of TurtleBot3 Using Lyapunov and PD Controllers

This repository contains the report showcasing implementation of trajectory control for the **TurtleBot3** differential drive robot using **Lyapunov-based** and 
**Proportional-Derivative (PD)** controllers. The project aims to achieve precise trajectory tracking in dynamic environments using **ROS** (Robot Operating System), 
**Simulink** for simulations, and **Gazebo** for testing.

Key Features
Trajectory Tracking: Implements two control strategies—Lyapunov and PD controllers—to ensure accurate path following for TurtleBot3.

ROS Integration: Uses ROS for communication between software components and the TurtleBot3 hardware.

Simulink Models: Simulink is utilized for implementing the controller and connected to the Gazebo/Turtlebot via ROS toolbox for controlling in real time.

Gazebo Testing: Gazebo is used for robot simulation and real-time validation of trajectory control in a 3D environment.

Dynamic Environment: Focuses on trajectory control in dynamic settings with dynamic paths and varying conditions.
